# Guru-Marketplace

The fulfillment of teachers' needs in Indonesia has become an increasingly challenging task, especially in the 3T areas (Remote,
Outermost, and Disadvantaged). The placement of teachers in Indonesia is considered uneven in every region, both centralized and underserved. In
light of this background, the idea of a 'Teacher Marketplace' emerged, proposed by Nadiem Makarim during a meeting of the Indonesian House of
Representatives' Commission X, which is believed to address the issue of teacher distribution in Indonesia. However, this idea has generated various
perceptions and perspectives among the public. The idea has been met with both support and opposition, with different underlying reasons. Some
view the 'Teacher Marketplace' as a solution, while others argue that the term 'marketplace' may diminish the noble profession of a teacher. This
research aims to analyze public sentiment towards the concept of the 'Teacher Marketplace' using the Na誰ve Bayes algorithm, and to evaluate the
effectiveness of the algorithm in predicting and assessing performance. Additionally, this study also aims to understand the public's perceptions and
views regarding this concept as a solution to the issue of teacher distribution in Indonesia. Several methodologies are employed in this research,
including problem and solution identification, followed by implementation involving data crawling, preprocessing, and performance evaluation. The
preprocessing stage and performance evaluation includes several steps such as cleaning, case-folding, stopword removal, stemming, tokenizing,
TF-IDF weighting, Na誰ve Bayes classification, and classification testing results. Based on sentiment analysis of Twitter data, the Na誰ve Bayes method
successfully classified sentiment from the 'Teacher Marketplace' data. In a dataset consisting of 2000 instances, sentiment classification yielded the
number of data categorized as positive and negative. The performance evaluation of sentiment analysis on public reactions to the 'Teacher
Marketplace' solution using the Na誰ve Bayes algorithm achieved an accuracy of 76%, which can be categorized as fairly good. In its implementation,
the sentiment analysis results showed a higher proportion of negative sentiment compared to positive sentiment.
